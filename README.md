# omoponfhir-omopv6-jpabase

Our main maintained version of OMOP is v6.0

Not all tables are implemented. Tables that are essential for OMOPonFHIR mapping and tables that might be needed for concepts and vocabularies are implemented. Please note that the JPA version will only be maintained until SqlRender version is fully implemented. After SqlRender version is fully implemented and operational, JPA will be decomissioned.
